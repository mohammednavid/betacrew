    firstDescp:"The pain of the tedious task of taking screenshots at each stage of designing is now eased, because at Bild you can not only discuss design visually as a team, but also have version control facility like GitHub offers for software. In the initial few days of its commencement, Bild sought BetaCrew to aid in their product development for the satisfactory designing of target module and features.",

    firstComment:"It's not an overstatement to say we've been able to overachieve with betacrew.",
    firstAbout:"Bild has opened up avenues for making the process of hardware designing and engineering much more rapid and easier. In addition to allowing for sharing the designing access, it also helps in communicating in the design panel itself. Live design viewing with the team and version control furthermore adds to the incredible features of Bild.",
    firstFullDescp:"BetaCrew joined Bild in its primal stage and dispensed an external team to work in coalition with their in-house team, while subtracting their care for hiring and multiplying the speed of the consolidated process. With BetaCrew's stellar developers/engineers and a very systematic, businesslike approach, Bild reached its goal two times faster than its anticipated due date, on top of closing a second round of funding. With a 100% satisfaction with our operations and strategies, Bild is an on-going client of ours.",
